\section{Acknowledgments}

GR conceived the follow-up study, developed the analysis pipeline, performed simulations, and wrote the manuscript. DG collected the original experimental data and performed behavioral segmentation. MMS supervised the project, provided experimental guidance, and revised the manuscript.

Marc Gershow authored MAGAT Analyzer (Gershow et al., 2012), which was used for trajectory extraction and behavioral state segmentation, including detection of reorientation events used in all kernel fitting and phenotyping analyses. GR thanks Professor Ki Young Jeong for teaching the fundamental concepts in simulation modeling and statistical inference that provided the theoretical foundation for this analysis.

Computational resources were provided by Syracuse University Research Computing and AWS GPU instances. Laboratory facilities were provided by the Department of Physics, Syracuse University. Members of the Mihovilovic-Skanata laboratory provided helpful discussions and feedback.
