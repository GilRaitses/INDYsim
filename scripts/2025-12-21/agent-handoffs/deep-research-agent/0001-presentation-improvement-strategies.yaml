# CONTEXT

background: |
  A scientific presentation on sensorimotor habituation in Drosophila larvae
  has been created with 27 slides. A comprehensive assessment identified
  several visual and structural problems that reduce presentation quality.
  
  The presentation uses LaTeX Beamer with the Metropolis theme and includes
  figures generated from Python matplotlib/seaborn scripts.
  
  The assessment graded the presentation B+ overall with specific issues
  categorized by priority.

# PROBLEMS TO RESEARCH

problem_1_caption_cutoff:
  description: |
    Several slide captions are cut off at the bottom of slides 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    The figures use height=0.68\textheight or similar which leaves insufficient
    space for multi-line captions in Beamer with Metropolis theme.
    
  current_approach: |
    Captions are placed using \vspace{0.15cm} followed by \small text.
    The figure height is set to 0.68\textheight.
    
  research_questions:
    - What is the recommended figure-to-caption ratio in Beamer presentations?
    - How does Metropolis theme handle footer space compared to default Beamer?
    - What are best practices for multi-line captions in scientific presentations?
    - Should captions be abbreviated or should figures be smaller?
    
  reference_file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GilRaitses/indysim/main/phenotyping_followup/presentation/combined_presentation_v3.tex

problem_2_legend_readability:
  description: |
    Legends in multi-panel matplotlib figures are too small to read when
    projected. This affects slides 5, 6, 9, and 13 which use figures
    generated from Python scripts.
    
  current_approach: |
    Figures are generated with default matplotlib legend sizes and then
    included in Beamer at reduced height. The double reduction makes
    legends nearly illegible.
    
  research_questions:
    - What font sizes are recommended for projected presentations?
    - Should legends be moved outside the figure panel area?
    - What matplotlib rcParams settings optimize for presentation figures?
    - Are there Beamer packages that can overlay larger legends?
    
  relevant_context: |
    Original figures were created for manuscript use where they appear
    at larger sizes. Presentation reuse requires different parameters.

problem_3_faq_text_walls:
  description: |
    FAQ slides 23-27 are text-only with no visual aids. Each slide has
    4-5 paragraphs of text which is difficult to follow in a presentation.
    
  current_approach: |
    FAQ content uses \textbf{} headers with \vspace for separation.
    No figures or icons are included.
    
  research_questions:
    - What are best practices for FAQ sections in scientific presentations?
    - Should FAQ slides use a two-column layout with icons?
    - How many FAQ items should appear per slide?
    - Are there LaTeX packages for simple scientific icons?
    - Should FAQ content be reduced and moved to supplementary materials?
    
  reference_file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GilRaitses/indysim/main/phenotyping_followup/presentation/combined_presentation_v3.tex

problem_4_repeated_figures:
  description: |
    The same figures are used in multiple slides which reduces visual impact.
    Specifically fig1_clustering_illusion appears in slides 9 and 19.
    fig3_hierarchical_shrinkage appears in slides 11 and 17.
    
  current_approach: |
    Recommendation slides reuse earlier figures with different captions
    to illustrate different points.
    
  research_questions:
    - Is figure repetition acceptable in scientific presentations?
    - Should repeated uses show zoomed or highlighted versions?
    - What LaTeX/TikZ techniques can overlay annotations on repeated figures?
    - Should unique figures be created for each recommendation slide?
    
  relevant_context: |
    The original figure scripts were deleted because they used synthetic
    placeholder data. Only the authentic multi-panel figures remain.

problem_5_transition_between_studies:
  description: |
    The transition from original study (slide 7) to follow-up study (slide 8)
    is abrupt. There is no bridge slide explaining what worked, what remains,
    and why the follow-up study was needed.
    
  current_approach: |
    Slide 7 ends with LOEO validation showing limitations.
    Slide 8 immediately presents Executive Summary of follow-up study.
    
  research_questions:
    - How should multi-study presentations handle transitions?
    - What content should appear on a bridge slide?
    - Should the bridge summarize both studies or just preview the follow-up?
    - Are there examples of two-study presentations in neuroscience?

problem_6_quantitative_emphasis:
  description: |
    Key numerical results are buried in paragraph text rather than
    visually emphasized. Important values include tau_1 = 0.3s,
    tau_2 = 4s, 100 events required, 10x information gain.
    
  current_approach: |
    Numbers appear inline with surrounding text using standard LaTeX
    math mode for Greek symbols.
    
  research_questions:
    - What techniques exist for emphasizing key statistics in Beamer?
    - Should callout boxes be used for important numbers?
    - How do other neuroscience presentations highlight key findings?
    - Are there Beamer templates with built-in callout styles?
